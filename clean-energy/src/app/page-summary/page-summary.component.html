  Hypothetically, 2300 TWh og energy per year is available from
  marine energy resources per year. Of this theoretical limit,
  nearly three quarters could be captured with the technologies
  being developed right now. Specifically, it shows how wave energy
  would make up the vast majority of energy that can currently
  be harnessed, with the potential to generate 1400 TWh per year
