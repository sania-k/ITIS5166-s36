  This graph shows the sources of marine energy, and the amount of households
  they could power in the millions. Marine energy on its own could power 220,000,000 homes,
  with wave energy independently accounting for over half that amount (130 million).
  This alone shows the potential of wave energy as a major source of
  clean energy which could benefit many lives without detriment to
  society.
